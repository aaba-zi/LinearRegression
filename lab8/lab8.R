# if carat:cut is expressed earlier than x:cut, there is no too much for x:cut to express, since caract:cut is sort of including x:cut. Thatâ€™s why the p-value for x:cut in m1 is significant but the p-value of x:cut is not.

# in nested model F-terst of m1 or m2 against m3, we found the p-value is 0.1487 which is less then 0.05, which means x:cut is not significant.
# m3 and m4 are both reduced model. they cannot compare with each other.
# Since we could miss some important interaction that could be significant.
# a group of regressors could each individually have p-values indicating that individually they are not significant but dropping all of them could still be significant.
